//Expressions(xs can be a list)
xs.map(x => x + 1)  is equivalent to    for (x <- xs) yield x + 1
xs.filter(x => x % 2 == 0)   is equivalent to     for (x <- xs if x % 2 == 0) yield x
xs.flatMap(x => ys.map(y => (x, y)))   is equivalent to    for (x <- xs; y <- ys) yield (x, y)

//Override
 override def toString = numer + "/" + denom   the modifier override declares that toString redefines a method that already exists

//Test
require is a predefined function. It takes a condition and an optional message string. If the condition passed to require is false, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown with the given message string.
require is used to enforce a precondition on the caller of a function.
assert is used as to check the code of the function itself

//Abstract class
Abstract classes can contain members which are missing an implementation.
Consequently, no instances of an abstract class can be created with the operator new

//Passing arbitrary number of values as parameters
def average(x: Int, xs: Int*): Double = {}

Sometimes you want to supply each element of a list as as many parameters. You can do that by adding a : _* type ascription to your list: val xs: List[Int] = â€¦
average(1, xs: _*)

Classes, objects and traits can inherit from at most one class but arbitrary many traits:


//Implicit Class(A class marked with implicit keyword)
The class will be in Objects Scope.Must be defined inside a object/trait/class

//implicit class RichDate(date: java.util.Date) // OK!(May take one Argument

//object Bar
//implicit class Bar(x: Int) // BAD!
//val x = 5
//implicit class x(y: Int) // BAD!


//Recursive Sum
def sum(x: Int, y: Int): Int = {
  if(x>y) 0 else x + sum(x+1,y)
}

sum(3,10)

//Fibnocci
  def fib(x: Int) = {
    var pre = 0
    var cur = 1
    var res = 0
    for (i <- pre to x) {
      res = pre + cur
      pre = cur
      cur = res
      print("\t" + res)
    }
  }

fib(10)

//Factorial
var ini = 1
for (f: Int  <- 5 to 2 by -1)
  ini = ini * f
  println(ini)
